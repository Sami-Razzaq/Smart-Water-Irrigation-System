# Smart-Water-Irrigation-System
A smart water irrigation system using Arduino UNO.

DHT11 is used to measure the humidity & temperature of the environment. Soil Moisture sensor measures the water/moisture in the soil. 
Values are processed in the Arduino UNO, which starts/stops a water pump (motor) based on Moisture Levels.
The water pump is controlled using a relay module.
Updated Humidity, Temperature, and Moisture are displayed on the LCD, along with the status of the pump (ON/OFF).

Components:
1. Arduino UNO
2. Soil Moisture Sensor
3. DHT11 Humidity & Temperature Sensor
4. Relay Module
5. LCD 16x2
6. Water Pump
